**Gobii** is a platform for launching fully managed `browser-use` agents in the cloud. Our API makes the full power of the Gobii platform accessible to developers and power users who want to build on top of our browser automation capabilities.

## Why use the Gobii API?

- **Simplified Browser Automation**: Focus on what you want to accomplish, not the technical details of web scraping
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Run hundreds of browser automation tasks in parallel
- **Reliable Results**: Our agents handle dynamic sites, JavaScript, CAPTCHAs, and other common challenges
- **Flexible Integration**: Easy-to-use API with clients for Python, Node.js, and more
- **Secure & Compliant**: Enterprise-grade security with comprehensive audit logs

## How It Works

1. **Create Agents**: Set up automation agents through our API
2. **Assign Tasks**: Tell your agents what to do with natural language instructions
3. **Retrieve Results**: Get structured data back once the task is complete
4. **Optional Sync & Schemas**: For quick jobs you can wait synchronously and receive results that are validated against your own JSON Schema.

## Common Use Cases

- **Data Collection**: Gather information from websites at scale
- **Process Automation**: Automate repetitive web tasks
- **Content Management**: Publish or update content across multiple platforms
- **Testing**: Validate your web applications in real browsers
- **Research**: Collect data for market analysis or academic research
