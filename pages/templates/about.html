    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Gobii envisions a future where intelligent agents collaborate seamlessly with humans to automate the
      countless web-based tasks that slow us down today. From gathering research to filling forms to orchestrating
      multi-step workflows, our cloud-hosted browser agents combine modern large-language models with resilient
      browser automation to act exactly where the APIs stop.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      We're starting by making <em>browser-use&nbsp;agents in the cloud</em> ridiculously easy: instant instances,
      built-in proxy rotation, live previews, and a single API call to spin up as many agents as your ideas demand.
      As models grow more capable, Gobii will give them the infrastructure—and guardrails—to work safely alongside
      users, turning clicks and keystrokes into pure leverage.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      If you believe the browser should be as programmable as an API, we'd love to hear from you.
