  <!-- Acceptance of Terms -->
  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>You must use the Service only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. By using Gobii, you further acknowledge that your use is subject to U.S. law and may be subject to additional terms and conditions of third-party websites or services with which you interact. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service (including any automation of third-party sites) is lawful and permitted by any applicable third-party policies.</p>

  <!-- Description of Service -->
  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Gobii provides a cloud-based browser automation platform and AI agents to help users automate interactions with websites via an API. We offer a free tier of service and may offer paid plans or usage-based billing as described on our website. The Service enables you to run automated web tasks (e.g. form filling, data extraction) at scale. Gobii is a U.S.-based company, and while our Service is accessible globally, it is operated from and legally grounded in the United States.</p>

  <!-- Sections 3–16 -->
  <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
  <p>To use certain features of the Service, you may need to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when registering, and to keep it updated. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials, and for all activities that occur under your account. You must promptly notify Gobii if you discover or suspect any unauthorized access to your account or a security breach.</p>

  <h2>4. Fees and Payment</h2>
  <p>Gobii’s Service currently includes a free tier, and we may offer paid subscription plans or usage-based billing for additional use of the Service. If you enroll in a paid plan or incur usage fees, you agree to pay all applicable fees as described for the Service. All fees are exclusive of taxes and are non-refundable except as required by law. We reserve the right to modify our fees or introduce new fees upon prior notice.</p>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use and User Conduct</h2>
  <p>When using Gobii, you agree to use the Service responsibly and for lawful purposes only. You will not use the Service to violate any law, third-party terms, or intellectual property rights, or to transmit harmful or prohibited content.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Websites and Services</h2>
  <p>Using Gobii may involve interacting with third-party websites or services. You acknowledge that such third-party sites are independent of Gobii and that their own terms apply to your use of them.</p>

  <h2>7. Modifications to Service and Availability</h2>
  <p>Gobii reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice. We do not guarantee uptime or availability unless otherwise agreed in a separate SLA.</p>

  <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Gobii be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages. Gobii’s total cumulative liability shall not exceed the greater of fees paid in the previous six months or US&nbsp;$100.</p>

  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Gobii and its affiliates from any claims arising out of your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. Gobii may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause.</p>

  <h2>12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware courts.</p>

  <h2>13. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>Gobii may revise these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>14. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
  <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service remain with Gobii and its licensors. You retain ownership of your own content submitted to the Service.</p>

  <h2>15. Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
