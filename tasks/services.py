# - "available" - refers to the number of task credits the user has that can be used immediately.
# - "granted" - refers to the number of task credits that have been granted to the user, regardless of whether

# - "entitled" - refers to the number of task credits that the user is entitled to, which may include addl_tasks that

# - "used" - refers to the number of task credits that have been used by the user.
#
# By default, all of this is "in range", that is, the task credits that are currently valid for the user, with a granted date
# in the past and an expiration date in the future. This is the most common use case.
