The open-source **browser-use** library changed what‚Äôs possible in web automation. For the first time, developers could control *real browsers* with LLMs‚Äîautomating adaptive, complex tasks that used to require brittle scripts or rigid RPA systems.

But deploying browser-use in production wasn‚Äôt simple. It meant building custom infrastructure, managing scaling and reliability, and maintaining your own orchestration logic.

[Gobii](https://gobii.ai) solves that.

Gobii is the production platform for browser-use ‚Äî built to run, manage, and scale entire fleets of AI browser agents across your organization. It turns the raw power of browser-use into something deployable, auditable, and usable by both developers and non-technical teams alike.

With [Gobii Open Source](https://github.com/gobii-ai/gobii-platform), you can now deploy that same production engine entirely on your own infrastructure‚Äîunder your full control.

## What Gobii Does

Gobii brings the reliability, security, and scalability that production environments demand.

- **No code required.** Spin up, configure, and control agents through a clean web UI.  
- **Persistent execution.** Agents keep running 24/7‚Äîno manual restarts.  
- **Dynamic adaptability.** Agents understand changing layouts, forms, and login flows.  
- **Scalable orchestration.** Launch dozens or hundreds of agents from one dashboard.  
- **Secure by design.** All sessions, credentials, and LLM calls stay inside your environment.

In short: **browser-use is the engine. [Gobii](https://gobii.ai) is the vehicle.**

## Why Open Source Matters

Open source isn‚Äôt just about licensing‚Äîit‚Äôs about trust, transparency, and long-term control.

With **Gobii Open Source**, teams can:

- **Inspect every line of code.** No black boxes, no hidden logic.  
- **Deploy anywhere.** From public cloud to air-gapped data centers.  
- **Integrate easily.** Extend via APIs, CI/CD, or your internal systems.  
- **Trust the process.** Gain full visibility into every step of execution.  

For security-sensitive organizations and enterprises with compliance requirements, this means browser automation you can finally rely on‚Äîwithout vendor lock-in.

## How Teams Use Gobii

Teams across industries are using Gobii to automate the kinds of tasks that break traditional systems:

- Lead generation and data enrichment across complex sites  
- Compliance and verification workflows  
- Large-scale data aggregation and reconciliation  
- Autonomous research and monitoring tasks  

Where scripts fail and RPA stops, **browser-use + Gobii** keeps going.

## The Bigger Picture

The rise of LLM-powered agents has made automation more intelligent‚Äîbut reliability, observability, and security have remained the missing pieces.

Gobii bridges that gap.

It‚Äôs where **AI autonomy meets production infrastructure**: the ability to launch agents that adapt to real-world changes, run continuously, and stay compliant with enterprise security standards.

For developers, Gobii removes the infrastructure barrier. For enterprises, it unlocks full deployment flexibility. And for everyone else‚Äîit makes powerful automation actually usable.
