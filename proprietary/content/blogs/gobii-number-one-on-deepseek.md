**PRESS RELEASE — FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
 **Gobii Becomes the \#1 Application on OpenRouter for DeepSeek V3.2 Within 72 Hours of Model Release**

San Francisco, CA — December 5, 2025 — Gobii, the open-core AI agent platform backed by Open Core Ventures, is now the \#1 application on OpenRouter for DeepSeek V3.2, the frontier model released on Monday, December 1. After integrating the new model into its system — enabling teams to run DeepSeek V3.2 through Gobii's always-on, self-hosted agents — usage climbed steadily over the first 72 hours.

DeepSeek V3.2 sits in the same class as OpenAI's GPT-5.1 and Google's Gemini Pro 3, surpassing them on several public benchmarks **while offering a 20–40× cost advantage (approximately $0.42 vs. $10–$20 for comparable models).** Its strong on-premise viability aligns with Gobii's architecture, which is designed for organizations requiring control, auditability, and data locality.

Gobii is a pre-seed startup launched in June 2025, backed by Open Core Ventures, the firm led by Sid Sijbrandij, the founder of GitLab. Despite its early stage, Gobii is seeing usage patterns more commonly associated with mature AI infrastructure platforms.

Gobii also became the **\#1 application for Mistral Large 3** in December. These December results follow a strong November in which Gobii held the **\#1 global usage position for the GLM-4.6 open-weights model**. Leadership across DeepSeek, Mistral, and GLM models reflects sustained, real-world usage rather than short-term testing.

"Teams are moving from experimentation toward operational adoption," said Andrew I. Christianson, founder of Gobii. "It's becoming feasible to do real-world work with fully open-source software paired with open-weights models, and enterprises are beginning to run these systems themselves."

### **Why Gobii Is Different**

* **Open-core and self-hosted:** Fully inspectable, modifiable, and deployed inside private or regulated environments.

* **No-code access:** Non-technical users can interact with agents directly through email or SMS.

* **Always-on agents:** Continuous, stateful agents with durable memory instead of single-use prompt chains.

* **High-assurance architecture:** Kubernetes-native, encrypted at rest, with strict access controls and human-in-the-loop oversight.

### **How Gobii Began**

Gobii was created to meet rising demand for AI systems that operate securely inside existing infrastructure and remain fully auditable. Christianson, a former DoD contractor who contributed to Apache NiFi, designed the platform to provide transparency, reliability, and predictable behavior.

"In environments where correctness and traceability matter, black-box AI is a liability," Christianson said. "Gobii gives organizations full visibility into how their agents work and confidence that they'll behave consistently."

### **About Gobii**

Gobii is the open-core AI workforce platform that delivers autonomous, always-on AI agents for regulated and high-assurance environments. Built for transparency and control, Gobii can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or fully air-gapped. Backed by Open Core Ventures, Gobii provides organizations with AI systems that are auditable, secure, and aligned with their internal standards.
