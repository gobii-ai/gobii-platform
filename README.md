# Gobii Platform

**Powered by [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)** üöÄ

Gobii is the open-source platform for always-on, web-browsing AI agents. Built on [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use), the leading browser automation framework for AI agents, Gobii lets you spin it up with Docker Compose, breeze through a first-run wizard, and you have self-hosted agents that navigate the web, gather structured insight, and keep working long after you log out. Prefer a managed experience? Gobii Cloud at [gobii.ai](https://gobii.ai) delivers the same agent stack as a hosted service.

## What Makes Gobii Different
- **[browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) superpowers**: Each agent leverages browser-use's advanced browser automation to search, click, fill forms, download files, and return structured JSON on demand.
- **Always-on agents**: Communicate with agents over email, web chat, or API, then let them handle follow-ups without manual checkpoints.
- **Own the runtime, choose the cloud**: MIT-licensed code keeps the core under your control, with Gobii Cloud available when you want SLAs and zero-ops hosting.

## Launch in Minutes
1. **Prerequisites**: Docker with at least 12 GB RAM allocated to its VM and a few GB of disk.
2. **Clone & enter the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gobii-ai/gobii-platform.git
   cd gobii-platform
   ```
3. **Start Gobii** (first run and whenever dependencies change)
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
4. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and follow the first-run wizard:
   - Create the first admin account.
   - Pick the LLM provider (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Fireworks, or custom) powering your agents.
   - Drop in the API keys and preferred models. You can route [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) calls to a different model if you'd like.
5. After the redirect, sign in at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and start building agents.

Need scheduling, inbox listeners, or extra telemetry later? Launch the optional `beat`, `email`, or `obs` profiles with `docker compose --profile <name> up`.

## Workflows You Can Ship Today
- Create agents powered by [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use), attach secrets, and wire up email or web chat handoffs.
- Hand teammates or services an API key so they can trigger browser-use jobs without touching the UI.
- Watch browser-use tasks stream results, capture structured JSON, or download files created along the way.

### Try the API
```bash
curl --no-buffer \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $GOBII_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tasks/browser-use/ \
  -d '{

        "wait": 60,
        "output_schema": {
          "type": "object",

          "required": ["headline"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }'
```
