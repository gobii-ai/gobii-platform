Hey 👋

Just a heads-up — {{ agent.name }} is out of task credits right now, so they can’t reply.

{% if billing_url %}
Add more credits{% if is_proprietary_mode %} (or upgrade your plan){% endif %} at {{ billing_url|safe }} and we’ll get right back to work for you!
{% else %}
Add more credits{% if is_proprietary_mode %} (or upgrade your plan){% endif %} in Gobii Billing and we’ll get right back to work for you!
{% endif %}

If you are not the agent owner, please let them know.
